Building an appropriate housing is a critical part of a controller build. Housing or enclosure secures the electronics from outside environment, as well as provides a mounting place for the different probes, equipment and display panels.

### Housing material

Depending upon where and what type of controller you are building you can use 3d-printed or wooden or out of the shelf plastic of metal enclosures. I personally use plywood since its easy to cut in pieces and all the material required are readily available.

### Things to consider

- Size and dimension of the housing. It should hold all electronics and any connectors required.
- Connector mounting holes. You are likely to mount female BNC connectors or 3.5mm audio connectors or barrel jacks. Make sure you design them before and consider the spacing between connector and other components
- Make it easy to reopen, if you think this is not a permanent installation.
- Make space for connecting Pi power jacks and usb/hdmi cable for troubleshooting purpose.
