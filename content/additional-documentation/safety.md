### Why should I read this?
You are working with a project that is great stuff for your coral, fish or whatever you want to automate. YOU ARE WORKING WITH WATHER together with ELECTRICITY. Ok... If you want to fry yourself, it is your responsebillety. But please think
 of all the living things in your tank alive.

### Introduction
If you are working with electronics, especialy with water and high voltige, keep in mind that it might be dangerous. That is why this page is added. It is not high voltage that will kill you but high current will. And with high current I mean milliamps. I you don't know what I'm talking about, please read this whole page. If you think it will never happen to me, please read this whole page. If you know what I'm talking about, please read this whole page.

### Okey, now that I have your attention.
One of my favorite pages that makes sense is: https://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~p616/safety/fatal_current.html And please read this.
If you did read this, you now know that with higher voltiges you will die and adding water to your skin the lower voltige can kill. Keep in mind that salt polutes the water and even bring down the resistance. With the efect that even lower voltage can kill you. I have seen sites that are saying that even a 1.5V battery can kill you with the right circumstances, but I don't think that those circumstances will ever been reached. Never the less, keep in mind that you and your tank are safe.

## If you are not sure on this topic, please search the internet, consult the internet, ask friends who do know about electricity and safety or just don't mess with it.

## Reef-pi or any contributer will never be responsible for any injury whatsoever for not thinking.
